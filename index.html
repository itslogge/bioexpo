			The effects of forest fires on climate change
		</h2>
		<h3>By: Logan Huff</h3>
		<p>
			The Amazon is the largest rainforest in the world, covering an area 25
			times larger than the UK (Carbon Brief, 2016). It also holds a quarter
			as much carbon as the atmosphere, as well as single-handedly absorbs
			around 2 billion tons of all the CO2 (or 5% of the annual emissions)
			produced each year. The amount of CO2 stored in the Amazon is equivalent
			to 10 years worth of the world‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions. The Amazon is
			not the world‚Äôs largest producer of oxygen, it only produces 5-6% of the
			world‚Äôs oxygen. The majority of the world‚Äôs oxygen actually comes from
			microscopic organisms called phytoplankton, accounting for 80% of the
			world‚Äôs oxygen. The Amazon rainforest fire not only reduces the amount
			of CO2 being absorbed by the trees but it is also releasing CO2 into the
			atmosphere as it burns.
		</p>
		<p>
			In August 2019, Brazil had already seen 74,000 fires, an 84% increase in
			the number of fires compared to the same time last year. Almost 40,000
			of those fires were in the Amazon and nearly 9,000 were over a one-week
			period in mid-August. If the Amazon was left to nature, it would rarely
			burn. But it isn‚Äôt being left alone, instead, it is being bulldozed and
			torched in order to make room for cattle pastures. Since 1970, around
			20% of the Amazon rainforest has been cleared to make room for
			large-scale agriculture and cattle pastures.
		</p>
		<p>
			Rising CO2 levels will cause the Amazon rainforest to choke and the
			trees won‚Äôt have to open their stomata (pores) as often to receive the
			same amount of carbon. This would cause the climate to become hotter and
			drier, thus straining the trees as well as raising the risk of
			uncontrolled fires that could devastate acres of forest. We are already
			seeing the effects of climate change, as it suppresses the rainforest‚Äôs
			ability to absorb CO2 by one third, according to the LA Times.
		</p>
		<p>
			A survey by the Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion and Statistics and
			activist group Avazz stated 96% of the respondents want the Brazilian
			government to take action against illegal deforestation.
		</p>
		<p>
			If nothing is done to prevent deforestation of the Amazon rainforest
			then the climate could be heading towards a tipping point where much of
			the rainforest becomes a savanna. At that point, it would begin
			releasing greenhouse gases instead of taking them in. It would become a
			vicious cycle that feeds on itself, accelerating the change more and
			more.
