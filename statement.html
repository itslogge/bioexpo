		<h1>❗ | Statement</h1>
		<h3 class="subtitle"></h3>
		<p>
			I decided to research this topic because I wanted to learn more about how great of an impact the Amazon Fire and wildfires, in general, are having on climate change. I didn't really know who I excepted to see this website. But wanted to share my findings with everyone, so a website was the perfect option.
		</p>
		<p>
			I believe that something must be done about the mass deforestation of the Amazon rainforest to make room for farmland. The main issue that has prevented this from changing is the president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, who has and continues to allow the slash-and-burn of the rainforest to continue.
		</p>
		<p>
			If we allow the deforestation to continue and it reaches 25%, there won’t be enough trees to cycle moisture throughout the rainforest. This will cause the forest to dry out and become a savanna.
		</p>
		<p>
			I hope that this paper shows people what unregulated human activity can and will do to the environment and not just the Amazon rainforest.
